# Aztec Flat

Inspired from Flatabulous. It is made more darker for LED/ LCD display with standard RGB color profile.

### Note 
The theme is fully functional on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 


### Bug
Ubuntu Gnome themes are not fully compatible with latest distro of Ubuntu 17.x. Border seems to be out of margin. Fix will be pushed once Ubuntu Gnome is fully stable with all developer tools.
